#### Welcome to DARC!
This document outlines the January competiton's rules and scoring. 

#### Updates
For this competition, we're increasing the level of difficult of soccer bots! Please read the rules carefully - robots who violate any part of the rules may be disqualified. Judges have final discretion over the interpretation of the DARC rules. Get your robot driving early to devote time to team planning and strategizing!

## Soccer Bot Rules
#### Field
- 	Goal = 2 ft x 4-6in x 9in
- 	Perimeter = 22in radius
- 	Field perimeter = 12 x 12ft
- 	Center circle = 2 ft radius

#### Scoring
- 	1 goal = 1 pt
- 	Must touch the back inside the goal lighting up the light

#### Robot Guidelines
- 	14.5in x 14.5in *no height limitations

#### Team
- 2 vs 2
- Teams of two are formed in advance. Opposing team is selected by judges on the day of competition. 
  
#### Timing
- 	2:00 games
  
#### Offense
- 	Can go inside perimeter of the opposing team at any time. 
- 	Can only “trap” the ball for 5 seconds at a time
- 	“Trapping” is defined as covering the ball so another team could not steal it, grasping the ball so it’s immoveable, lifting the ball off the ground, or any other act that makes the ball inaccessible to the other teams.

#### Defense
- 	Can not go in perimeter or “goalie box” (ie you can not sit in the goal)

#### Offsides
- If the defensive robot is pushed into the perimeter it does not count as offsides
- If the offensive robot is in the perimeter, the defensive robot is allowed in the perimeter and it is not offsides.
- If however the defensive robot crosses the perimeter before an offensive robot without being pushed then it is offsides - play is stopped and the robot that committed the penalty is but behind the center line in the center circle.

#### Prohibited activity
- As long as the construction of the robot is not intended to dismantle another robot it’s fine. Contact with other robots is allowed
