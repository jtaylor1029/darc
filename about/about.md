We have found that many students come out of FLL (First Lego League) and go to schools and hope to participate in FTC (First Tech Challenge).  FTC is expensive and has a significant learning curve.  We have found for our younger students that having a league geared to toward learning robotics and ramping them up to gain the skills that will lead them to be successful later in FTC is important.  We have also found that many  schools hope to start a FTC team but lack the support to get going. Our hope is that DARC will be fun, challenging, and supportive of a wide range of teams (new teams, younger students, returning students who have limited time, etc).
